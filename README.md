## üìñ Overview

Cloud Craver is a powerful, command-line-driven framework for simplifying cloud infrastructure management. It provides a unified interface to provision, manage, and monitor resources across multiple cloud providers. Built for DevOps engineers, cloud architects, and FinOps professionals, Cloud Craver streamlines complex workflows, enforces best practices, and helps control cloud costs effectively.

Whether you're deploying a simple VM or managing a complex multi-cloud environment, Cloud Craver offers the tools to do it efficiently and safely.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **ü§ñ IaC Automation:**
    Leverage the power of Terraform to automate your infrastructure provisioning. Cloud Craver provides a simplified interface to generate, validate, and apply Terraform configurations.

*   **üí∞ Cost Management & Optimization:**
    Get a clear picture of your cloud spending. Estimate costs before deployment, get optimization suggestions based on usage patterns, compare costs across providers, and generate detailed reports.

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance:**
    Integrate security into your CI/CD pipeline. Scan your Terraform plans for vulnerabilities and enforce security policies to ensure your infrastructure is compliant with industry standards.

*   **üîå Extensible Plugin System:**
    Cloud Craver is built to be modular. Extend its core functionality with custom plugins to integrate with new services, create custom commands, or tailor it to your organization's specific needs.

*   **üåê Multi-Cloud Support:**
    Manage resources across AWS, Azure, and GCP through a single, consistent command-line interface.

*   **üìä Interactive Dashboard:**
    (Coming Soon) A web-based dashboard to visualize your cloud environment, track resource usage, and monitor costs in real-time.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **Terraform**
*   **Cloud Provider Credentials:** Configure your AWS, Azure, or GCP credentials on your local machine. Cloud Craver uses the standard SDKs (like `boto3` for AWS) which automatically detect these credentials.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OSoC-25-Cloud-Craver.git
    cd OSoC-25-Cloud-Craver
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Quick Start

Let's start by initializing the system and listing the available Terraform templates.

1.  **Initialize Cloud Craver:**
    ```bash
    python cloudcraver.py init
    ```
    This command sets up the necessary configuration files and initializes the plugin system.

2.  **List available templates:**
    ```bash
    python cloudcraver.py list-templates
    ```
    This will show you the pre-built Terraform templates you can generate.

## üíª Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate and Validate a Terraform Template

This example shows how to generate a Terraform template for an AWS S3 bucket, and then validate it.

1.  **Generate the template interactively:**
    ```bash
    python cloudcraver.py interactive-generate
    ```
    Follow the on-screen prompts to select the `aws-s3-bucket` template and specify an output directory.

2.  **Navigate to the output directory:**
    ```bash
    cd generated-templates/aws-s3-bucket
    ```

3.  **Validate the generated Terraform code:**
    ```bash
    python ../../cloudcraver.py validate .
    ```
    This will run `terraform init` and `terraform validate` on the generated code.

### Example 2: Estimate the Cost of a Terraform Plan

This example shows how to generate a Terraform plan and then estimate its cost.

1.  **Generate a plan:**
    Assuming you are in a directory with Terraform files (`.tf`), run:
    ```bash
    python cloudcraver.py terraform plan-generate --directory . --out-file my-plan.json
    ```
    This will create a JSON representation of the Terraform plan.

2.  **Estimate the cost:**
    ```bash
    python cloudcraver.py cost estimate AWS --tfplan my-plan.json
    ```
    Cloud Craver will analyze the plan and provide a monthly cost estimate.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command Reference

Cloud Craver uses a `group` and `command` structure. For detailed help on any command or group, use the `--help` flag.

```bash
python cloudcraver.py [GROUP] [COMMAND] --help
```

### Core Commands
*   `init`: Initialize Cloud Craver.
*   `status`: Show the system status.
*   `list-templates`: List available Terraform templates.
*   `generate`: Generate a Terraform template by name.

## üîß Configuration

Cloud Craver can be configured via a `settings.toml` file located in the `src/config` directory. You can create a `local_settings.toml` to override the default settings without modifying the version-controlled files.

Copy the example:
```bash
cp src/config/local_settings.example.toml src/config/local_settings.toml
```
Then, edit `src/config/local_settings.toml` to fit your needs.

## üß© Plugin System

The plugin system allows you to extend Cloud Craver's functionality. Plugins can add new commands, integrate with new services, or create custom workflows.

The core plugin logic is located in `src/plugins`. To create your own plugin, you can follow the structure of the example plugins and register it in the `entry_points` section of `setup.py` (if this were a packaged application). For now, you can add modules to the `src/cli` and `src/plugins` directories.
